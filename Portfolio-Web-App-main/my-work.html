            The GUI App I made with my partner Henry is the Tic-Tac-Toe game . Like the game in real life have three matching characters in a row you win. The app allows you to click on grid and inputting
            character then it switch to another character to place their character. They can't place their character on an already taken gird box. Once the there are
            three row matching characters the game will end and show wins additionally increasing the player count wins. There is replay feature to play again and in the top
            right it shows who's turn it is. Our wins were having a replay feature, changing the font and font size of the text as well as adding colour to the X and O,
            displaying who's turn it is. And our challenges were the for loops variables were causing issues something about local scope, creating multiple JLabels as it use to replace the other JLabel,
            working with git, not being able to create branches. Wins were making the score board, having the players movement, creating the circle to move properly. Challenges were figuring out
            how to use JavaFX and while trying switching IDE, making a border had to redo due to the horizontal border breaking everything, and finding where the error due a bunch red lines
            that don't tell the actual thing that's breaking the code
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="explainGUI">
        <p>
            The GUI App was made by using Java Swing library and Java awt. Me and Henry first created a JButton variable gridArea that would be a double array variable that would be the boxes
            in the tic-tac-toe game, the array variable had nothing, so we change what its in the box by clicking on the box. The we created a double for loop that would
            create the sizes of the boxes. Made another JButton variable that would contain original gridArea but with the double array contain the for loop variables due to 
            local scope variable issues. The we used actionListener so that if the boxes were empty once you clicked it would put a X or O and switch every turn. Then we made it
            check win conditions for the y column and x column with a for loops and if statements, while the diagnal win conditons were just if statements. In those win checkers
            it make certain variable which determined if player X or O won. Which trigger another if statement increasing the win counter variable by one and using setText to show
            which player won and how wins that player has. We should who's turn it was with JLabel variable that change the text and would see who's turn it is with an if statement.
            Replay feature creating JButton and resetting the JButton gridArea back to being empty and the gameWon variable to be false which stop people from changing boxes even after
            the game is won by a person. Lastly, we incresed the text size, colour, and border size. Saving number of wins a player has even after closing the game. Voice lines on
            who's turn it is and what box is being hover over to have it be more accessible to
            people.

        <p>The Culminating Project I am working on is Pong like game Victorious Volleys, but with more features. The game has two rectangles you can move using the keyboard one rectangle controls being WASD
            and the other being TFGH. They can move in both the x and y direction, but cannot go out of the screen. There is a center dash line
            that prevents the rectangles from going to each other side. There is ball that the rectangles to  bounce of them to the other player
            which increase the speed of the ball. The ball does bounce on the top and  bottom screen borders, but it doesn't increase
            the speed. If the ball goes out of the screen on the right or left it is a point for one of the players. Additonally there is power
            up that comes into the game which will slow the other player down. The game is to 10, and shows who wins, what there win streak is, and 
            shows the play again button.

            I created the game through Java using JavaFX library to make it easier to build the game.
            I made IDs with JavaFX, so I can link lines of code to the objects in my SceneBuilder which is an easy
            way to make scenes and objects. The AnchorPane in SceneBuilder needs to be linked to a class file
            to get the IDs made and the code of the class. I made boolean variables for keys, so that when a key was pressed it became true making it
            meet the conditions for moving the players. The movement of the players was made by getting where they
            were on the screen using getLayout function and then add or subtract depending which way I wanted to move the player.
            For example, to move the player down I would add to the x value of getLayoutX of the players.
